TeamCity integration with RMTrack issue tracking
================================================

Works with hosted RMTrack service and probably with standalone installation. 
You'll need access and secret keys. They can be found in RMT administrative UI.
Tested with TeamCity 4.0.15.

The latest distribution can be downloaded from 
[here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/teamcity-rmtrack/rmtrack.zip).

To build the project rename build.properties.template to build.properties, 
adjust a path to TC installation.
Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, build all.
