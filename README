TeamCity integration with RMTrack issue tracking

Works with hosted RMTrack service. You'll need access and secret keys. They could be found in RMT administrative UI.
Tested with TeamCity 6.5.2.

To build the project rename build.properties.template to build.properties, adjust a path to TC installation.
Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, build all.
